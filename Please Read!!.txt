PLEASE READ BEFORE APPLYING THE BOOT ANIMATIONS!!


Some boots may cause bootloops on some devices with RAM less than 3GB
-Radiate
-Google Evolved          are the known ones 


I've checked all animations, and all of them works fine for me on my 3T. It may vary based
on your device.


SO APPLY AT YOUR ON RISK. TAKE A BACKUP BEFORE HAND. COMPLAINING IN REVIEWS WON'T HELP YOU

INSTRUCTIONS :

1) Install Substratum theme engine
2) Install this theme
3) Open substratum and grant it root access(if needed) and other permissions
4) Tap on the Boot for Subs card
5) Select the boot animations you like from the respective tab
6) A preview will be loaded and apply it

Previews can be found in the companion app(if they do not load up for you)
